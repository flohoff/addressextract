`addressextract` parses an OpenStreetmap PBF file and exports all addresses e.g. objects with `addr:*`
tags on them. It also reassembles admin and postcode boundarys and extends the addressinformation
with those.

A typical address looks like this:

    {
      "city": "Paderborn",
      "geomcity": "Paderborn",
      "geomcounty": "Kreis Paderborn",
      "geompostcode": "33098",
      "geomsuburb": "Paderborn",
      "housenumber": "2a",
      "id": "25906061",
      "lat": "51.717383",
      "lon": "8.752651",
      "postcode": "33098",
      "source": "node",
      "street": "Marienplatz"
    }

All the `geom*` tags originate from the boundaries, be it postcode or admin boundary.
`id` and `source` tell the origin osm object be it node or way and its id.

Additionally you could run the extractor with "-e" so it will add an error field
describing problems with this address - It could look like this:

      "errors": [
        "No housenumber",
        "No postcode",
        "No addr:street or addr:place"
      ]
